# Running squids locally (quest edition)

This tutorial should help new Subsquid testnet users get their first squids up and running locally.

## Installing dependencies

```mdx-code-block
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows" default>
```
1. Enable [Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
2. Install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/).
3. Install NodeJS LTS using the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
4. Install [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

In all installs it is OK to leave all the options at their default values. You will need a terminal to complete this tutorial - [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) bash is the preferred option.
```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">
```
1. Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/).
2. Install Git using the [installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/) or by [other means](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).
3. Install NodeJS LTS using the [official installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

We recommend configuring NodeJS to install global packages to a folder owned by an unprivileged account. Create the folder by running
```bash
mkdir ~/global-node-packages
```
then configure NodeJS to use it
```bash
npm config set prefix ~/global-node-packages
```
Make sure that the folder `~/global-node-packages/bin` is in `PATH`. That allows running globally installed NodeJS executables from any terminal. Here is a one-liner that detects your shell and takes care of setting `PATH`:
```
CURSHELL=`ps -hp $$ | awk '{print $5}'`; case `basename $CURSHELL` in 'bash') DEST="$HOME/.bash_profile";; 'zsh') DEST="$HOME/.zshenv";; esac; echo 'export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"' >> "$DEST"
```
Alternatively you can add the following line to `~/.zshenv` (if you are using zsh) or `~/.bash_profile` (if you are using bash) manually:
```
export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"
```

Re-open the terminal to apply the changes.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
```
Install NodeJS (v16 or newer), Git and Docker using your distro's package manager.

We recommend configuring NodeJS to install global packages to a folder owned by an unprivileged account. Create the folder by running
```bash
mkdir ~/global-node-packages
```
then configure NodeJS to use it
```bash
npm config set prefix ~/global-node-packages
```
Make sure that any executables globally installed by NodeJS are in `PATH`. That allows running them from any terminal. Open the `~/.bashrc` file in a text editor and add the following line at the end:
```
export PATH="${HOME}/global-node-packages/bin:$PATH"
```
Re-open the terminal to apply the changes.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

## Installing Subsquid CLI

Open a terminal and run
```bash
npm install --global @subsquid/cli
```
This adds the [`sqd` command](/squid-cli). Verify that the installation was successful by running
```bash
sqd --version
```
The response should look similar to this:
```
@subsquid/cli/2.4.3 linux-x64 node-v20.4.0
```

### Running a simple squid

1. Think of a good, globally unique name for your new squid. Now open a terminal and run the following commands to create the squid and enter its folder:
   ```bash
   sqd init my-awesome-squid -t https://github.com/subsquid-labs/quest-single-chain-squid-0
   cd my-awesome-squid
   ```
   Replace `my-awesome-squid` with the name you chose for your squid. If a squid with that name already exists, the first command will throw an error; if that happens simply think of another name and repeat the commands.

2. Download your squid deployment key and save it at the squid folder as a `./key` file. The file will be used by the query gateway container.

3. The template squid uses a PostgreSQL database and a query gateway. Start Docker containers that run these with
   ```bash
   sqd up
   ```
4. Prepare the squid for running by installing dependencies, building the source code and creating all the necessary database tables:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   sqd build
   sqd migration:apply
   ```
5. Start your squid with
   ```bash
   sqd run .
   ```
   The command should output lines like these:
   ```
   [api] 09:56:02 WARN  sqd:graphql-server enabling dumb in-memory cache (size: 100mb, ttl: 1000ms, max-age: 1000ms)
   [api] 09:56:02 INFO  sqd:graphql-server listening on port 4350
   [processor] 09:56:04 INFO  sqd:processor processing blocks from 6000000
   [processor] 09:56:05 INFO  sqd:processor using archive data source
   [processor] 09:56:05 INFO  sqd:processor prometheus metrics are served at port 33097
   [processor] 09:56:08 INFO  sqd:processor:mapping Burned 59865654 Gwei from 6000000 to 6016939
   [processor] 09:56:08 INFO  sqd:processor 6016939 / 17743832, rate: 5506 blocks/sec, mapping: 304 blocks/sec, 182 items/sec, eta: 36m
   ```
   The squid should sync in 10-15 minutes. When it's done, stop it with Ctrl-C, then stop and remove the auxiliary containers with
   ```bash
   sqd down
   ```

### Running a multiprocessor squid

Redo the previous section using a special multichain squid template prepared for the quest. This change will only affect the first two commands:
```bash
sqd init my-awesome-multichain-squid -t https://github.com/subsquid-labs/quest-multi-chain-squid-0
cd my-awesome-multichain-squid
```
Here, `my-awesome-multichain-squid` is a placeholder for the name you should choose for your awesome multiprocessor squid.

The rest of the commands do not need to be changed. An output of a healthy multichain template squid looks like this:
```
[api] 10:05:05 WARN  sqd:graphql-server enabling dumb in-memory cache (size: 100mb, ttl: 1000ms, max-age: 1000ms)
[api] 10:05:05 INFO  sqd:graphql-server listening on port 4350
[bsc-processor] 10:05:07 INFO  sqd:processor processing blocks from 27000000
[eth-processor] 10:05:07 INFO  sqd:processor processing blocks from 16000000

[eth-processor] 10:05:10 INFO  sqd:processor 16003899 / 17743832, rate: 1482 blocks/sec, mapping: 616 blocks/sec, 1154 items/sec, eta: 20m
[bsc-processor] 10:05:11 INFO  sqd:processor 27002719 / 30168778, rate: 787 blocks/sec, mapping: 542 blocks/sec, 1041 items/sec, eta: 1h 8m
```
You need to wait for both processors to sync to complete the quest. The ETA is 25-40 minutes.
