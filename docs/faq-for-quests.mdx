# Subsquid F.A.Q. for quest takers

### What does Subsquid Network do?

Subsquid Network will provide permissionless access to historical blockchain data in an easily digestible form, for free.

<details>
<summary>Who pays for the party?</summary>

For the moment, a Swiss company called Subsquid Gmbh. It is funded by the networks supported by Subsquid and by the proceeds of its [cloud service](#why-run-my-squid-in-subsquid-cloud).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Is Subsquid like Alchemy?</summary>

Unlike Alchemy, we do not provide direct access to RPC nodes. Instead, the data is provided in a form that is easier to filter and process in large batches.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Perhaps like The Graph, then?</summary>

Functionality is similar, tech is not.

Unlike subgraphs, [Subsquid indexers](#wtf-is-a-squid) get most of their data from [Archives](/archives/evm). Archives can filter data and retrieve large chunks of it at once. The data is processed on a [per-chunk](/basics/batch-processing) rather than per-item basis, reducing the number of database queries. All of this leads to much faster sync times.

Another huge difference is flexibility: unlike subgraphs, squids can mix in [any external data](/basics/external-api) during the data transform.

Like The Graph, Subsquid is [in the process of decentralizing its service](/subsquid-network), although using a very different architecture.

See [this page](/migrate/subsquid-vs-thegraph) for a more complete comparison.

### Which networks are supported?

Ethereum VM-compatible ([list](/evm-indexing/supported-networks)) and [Substrate](https://substrate.io)-based ([list](/substrate-indexing/supported-networks)).

For simplicity we'll discuss just the EVM indexing, as our approach and capabilities on Substrate are nearly identical.

### What data exactly?

Event logs and transactions. On some networks (notably Ethereum and Binance) also execution traces and [contract state](https://coinsbench.com/solidity-layout-and-access-of-storage-variables-simply-explained-1ce964d7c738) updates. See the [list of supported networks](/evm-indexing/supported-networks).

<details>
<summary>Wen more networks?</summary>

We add support for networks based on a number of factors. If you would like to see a network added, drop us a line at [this email](d.langellotti@subsquid.io).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Wen more data?</summary>

Execution traces and contract state diffs are added on a best effort basis: we try, if it doesn't work right away we fix stuff and try again. Sometimes we find a workaround, sometimes we have to wait the developers of the network in question to fix something. In short, _it depends_. You can track our progress [here](https://github.com/orgs/subsquid/projects/11).

### WTF is a squid?

A [squid](/basics/overview/#architecture) is an indexer app that you can use to retrieve data from Subsquid. You can run squids on your own infrastructure or [in our cloud](/deploy-squid/quickstart). You can also opt to access Subsquid data directly through [Archive API](/archives/evm).

### Why use squids?

Squids are built with [Subsquid SDK](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-sdk), which allows you to

1. Seamlessly mix historical data with real-time data from RPC. Hot blocks/forks/reorganizations [are supported](/basics/unfinalized-blocks).
2. Save data [to Postgres](/store/postgres) or [in files](/store/file-store) (local or [remote](/store/file-store/s3-dest)).
3. With Postgres you can also serve your data over a built-in [GraphQL API](/graphql-api).
4. Mix in any data you want, be it output of [contract state queries](/evm-indexing/query-state) or [calls to external APIs](/basics/external-api).

You get to transform your data with arbitrary TypeScript code. SDK provides [a tool](/evm-indexing/squid-evm-typegen) that simplifies working with contract binary data and constants.

### Why run my squid in Subsquid cloud?

[Ease of deployment](/deploy-squid/quickstart), [competitive pricing](/deploy-squid/pricing), access to our [RPC proxy](/deploy-squid/rpc-proxy) service for real-time data.

### What are some of our plans for the future?

- Completely decentralize our data lakes by building [Subsquid network](/subsquid-network). Currently in the testnet stage.
- Expand our [library](https://github.com/subsquid-labs/Subsquid-Datasets) of public [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org) datasets with task-specific data.
- Support Solana.
