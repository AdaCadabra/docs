# codegen

The `codegen` is used to generate TypeScript classes that model the entities defined in `schema.graphql` file.

It has no options and no output, but it will generate code in the `src/model/generated` folder.

To see examples of its usage, head over to the [Tutorial about creating a simple Squid](/docs/tutorials/create-a-simple-squid#define-entity-schema).

### Example

```
sqd codegen
```
