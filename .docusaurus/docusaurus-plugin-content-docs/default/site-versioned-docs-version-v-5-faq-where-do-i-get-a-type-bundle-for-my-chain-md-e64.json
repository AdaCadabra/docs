  "title": "Where do I get a type bundle for my chain?",
  "description": "Most chains publish their type bundles as an npm package (for example: Edgeware). One of the best places to check for the latest version is the polkadot-js/app and polkadot-js/api repositories. It's worth noting, however, that a types bundle is only needed for pre-Metadata v14 blocks, so for recently deployed chains it may be not needed.",
